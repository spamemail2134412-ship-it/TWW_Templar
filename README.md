West Z (Name is a parody of West X) is an autofarm script that is currently in development for https://www.roblox.com/games/2317712696/The-Wild-West. The script is a WIP and does not yet have full functionality or autofarm capability, though will in the future.

[West Z was not developed by West X developers.]

[West Z as of now is only working on Solara due to it's usage of keypress() to simulate user inputs, this is subject to change however, as when I get my hands on a lvl 8 executor in which I can use a remote spy on TWW to view RemoteEvents, they can be triggered via script.]
