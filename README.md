Templar is an autofarm script that is currently in development for https://www.roblox.com/games/2317712696/The-Wild-West. The script is a WIP and does not yet have full functionality or complete autofarm capability, though will in the future.

**HOW TO USE:**

  Path Recorder:
  - The parser for premade paths will iterate through the txt file and complete every action in the order in which it's listed (and wait for it to finish before continuing with the next action).
  - In the spawns section, when a button it will copy the spawn location to the txt file. Each spawn has its own button, you should record a path respawn at the start of every path file.
  - The record sell button simply moves the char to the registered position (similar to the move button) and will press F to sell loot.
  - The record pos button will move the char to the recorded position. There should be frequent recorded positions in the path file.

  Setup:
  - When launching the script, a folder will be created in your executor Workspace called TWW_Templar, this folder is where all path files will be copied to.
  - To start a path autofarm, simply select what txt file you want to use with the text box. It needs to be the full file name with the .txt file extension.
  - Your executors auto execute setting MUST BE TURNED ON FOR THE AUTOFARM TO WORK. Otherwise, server hopping will not work.
  - If your executor does not have auto execute, then download velocity or volcano which both have the functionality.

  What executor do I use?:
  - A level 8 executor is recommended or the script may not work, use velocity or volcano. Both are free.

  Features:
  - Automine player/Paths parser
  - Path recorder
  
-- Once released, Templar will be free.
